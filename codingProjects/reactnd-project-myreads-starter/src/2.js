So far, Thrun has developed robots that can be tour guides and nurses and can help save miners trapped underground. In 2004, he won a US Department of Defense contest by building a car that could drive itself. Since then, the self-driving cars he developed have been tested on more than 140,000 miles (225,308 kilometers) of road without fail! Thrun more recently developed a free website for online education and worked on Google Glass, a computer that can be worn like a pair of eyeglasses. But how did he get involved in all these cool projects? Follow his rise from a computer enthusiast to robotics innovator!",

            "description": "God’s Plan for His Chosen reaches back to ages past to address events that served as precursors to Adam. Such major events included God’s drafting of His detailed plan for those He would create in His own image, along with the participants in that plan. A major part of the curse resulting from the sin in the garden of Eden included God’s proclamation to Satan that He would put enmity between him and the woman and between his seed and her Seed. Such began the odyssey of redemption for man and the ongoing conflict between God’s chosen and the enemy and his seed. Much is said about the conflict and the differences between the kingdom minority and the world majority. The lengthiest and final chapter of God’s Plan for His Chosen is in fact entitled: “What in the ‘World’ Is the Majority Up To These Days” and addresses such issues as secular progressivism in America. This book is ideally suited for group Bible studies inasmuch as 959 verses are quoted from 51 books of the Bible.",

It provides actionable techniques to help managers assess their current practices and employ new ways of thinking about the business plan. Highlights Include: Revealing counter-productive performance measures Identifying the operational objectives that will realize the greatest profits Managing with optimization techniques Reassessing the make-or-buy decision Incorporating lean manufacturing activities into the aggregate plan Rethinking traditional capital project ranking techniques Measuring the financial impact of multiplant operations. Employing a hypothetical company case study, based on the author's actual experiences, Maximizing Profit guides you through a series of common manufacturing decisions such as product mix, process improvement, make-or-buy, and capital investment. A CD with an interactive Excel Solver spreadsheet tool — an optimization algorithm — is included that allows you to follow the team in the case study step-by-step as they shed prior assumptions and use optimization techniques to inform decisions. Maximizing Profit's practical information on the major decisions that will increase cash flow make it a \"must read\" and \"must have\" book for managers in manufacturing entities, specifically, general managers, manufacturing/operations managers, controllers, manufacturing/industrial engineers, and purchasing managers, as well as students of industrial business management.",

Explanation-based neural network learning (EBNN) is a machine learning algorithm that transfers knowledge across multiple learning tasks. When faced with a new learning task, EBNN exploits domain knowledge accumulated in previous learning tasks to guide generalization in the new one. As a result, EBNN generalizes more accurately from less data than comparable methods. Explanation-Based Neural Network Learning: A Lifelong Learning Approach describes the basic EBNN paradigm and investigates it in the context of supervised learning, reinforcement learning, robotics, and chess. `The paradigm of lifelong learning - using earlier learned knowledge to improve subsequent learning - is a promising direction for a new generation of machine learning algorithms. Given the need for more accurate learning methods, it is difficult to imagine a future for machine learning that does not include this paradigm.' From the Foreword by Tom M. Mitchell.",

            "description": "Abstract: \"This paper describes a scalable algorithm for the simultaneous mapping and localization (SLAM) problem. SLAM is the problem of determining the location of environmental features with a roving robot. Many of today's popular techniques are based on extended Kalman filters (EKFs), which require update time quadratic in the number of features in the map. This paper develops the notion of sparse extended information filters (SEIFs), as a new method for solving the SLAM problem. SEIFs exploit structure inherent in the SLAM problem, representing maps through local, Web-like networks of features. By doing so, updates can be performed in constant time, irrespective of the number of features in the map. This paper presents several original constant-time results of SEIFs, and provides simulation results that show the high accuracy of the resulting maps in comparison to the computationally more cumbersome EKF solution.\"",

            "description": "Over the past three decades or so, research on machine learning and data mining has led to a wide variety of algorithms that learn general functions from experience. As machine learning is maturing, it has begun to make the successful transition from academic research to various practical applications. Generic techniques such as decision trees and artificial neural networks, for example, are now being used in various commercial and industrial applications. Learning to Learn is an exciting new research direction within machine learning. Similar to traditional machine-learning algorithms, the methods described in Learning to Learn induce general functions from experience. However, the book investigates algorithms that can change the way they generalize, i.e., practice the task of learning itself, and improve on it. To illustrate the utility of learning to learn, it is worthwhile comparing machine learning with human learning. Humans encounter a continual stream of learning tasks. They do not just learn concepts or motor skills, they also learn bias, i.e., they learn how to generalize. As a result, humans are often able to generalize correctly from extremely few examples - often just a single example suffices to teach us a new thing. A deeper understanding of computer programs that improve their ability to learn can have a large practical impact on the field of machine learning and beyond. In recent years, the field has made significant progress towards a theory of learning to learn along with practical new algorithms, some of which led to impressive results in real-world applications. Learning to Learn provides a survey of some of the most exciting new research approaches, written by leading researchers in the field. Its objective is to investigate the utility and feasibility of computer programs that can learn how to learn, both from a practical and a theoretical point of view.",

The lifelong learning framework assumes instead that the learner encounters a multitude of related learning tasks over its lifetime, providing the opportunity for the transfer of knowledge. This paper studies lifelong learning in the context of binary classification. It presents the invariance approach, in which knowledge is transferred via a learned model of the invariances of the domain. Results on learning to recognize objects from color images demonstrate superior generalization capabilities if invariances are learned and used to bias subsequent learning.\"",
